## Built With

- [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) - Essential cross-platform UI components for React Native
- [Reduxsauce](https://github.com/infinitered/reduxsauce) - Some aesthetic toppings for your Redux meal

## Known issues

- Navigation - Cannot perform login due to new navigation structure which I am not so familiar with it.

- Data Nor Persistant - I am not implementing persistent because usually most of data depends on the API call.
